                    Zack and Gloria Waint have been running rivers together for 15 years.  They met at a river
                    guide training camp, and opened Whitewater Rafting within a year of being married.  Zach first 
                    learned to tame the whitewater when he was 12 years old while rafting with his father
                    on the Snake River.  Gloria took her first trip on the river during a college spring 
                    break. She was hooked and has since been on over 200 runs.  They can't wait to see you out there!

                    with us, you can thank him!  In the off season, Alex runs his own photography studio and enjoys

                    Jenn lives and breathes on the water.  When she isn't guiding one of our adventures she is out 
                    there kayaking, sailing, swimming, and even river ice skating.  Originally from Alaska, Jenn has
                    been with our team for 5 years now.  She knows all the best spots for a good view or a good splash.

                    degree in environmental science.  When he isn't studying or guiding our rafts through the 
                    drops and stretches, he is busy making the world a better place.  He enjoys volunteering, recycling,
                    tutoring, and fly fishing.
