                    <p>
                       Zack and Gloria Waint have been running rivers together for 15 years.  They even met on at a river
                       guide training!  They opened Whitewater Rafting together because they want to share their love and 
                       expertize with you.  Zach first learned to tame the whitewater when he was 12 years old.  His father
                       taught him everything he knows.  Gloria took her first trip on the river during a spring break from 
                       her college studies of biology.  She was hooked!  Whitewater Rafting is their baby and they put all 
                       their love into it.  They can't wait to see you out there!

                        Meet Alex!  Not only does Alex know the river like the back of his hand, but he is also a 
                        professional photographer.  When you get your beautiful river adventure photos after a trip 
                        with us, you can thank him!  In the off season, Alex runs his own photography studio and enjoys 
                        skiing, blogging, and catching up on his favorite shows.

                        Jenn lives and breathes on the water.  When she isn't guiding one of our adventures she is out 
                        there kayaking, sailing, swimming, and even river ice skating.  Originally from Alaska, Jenn has
                        been with our team for 5 years now.  She knows all the best spots for a good view or a good splash.

                        Give a big welcome to Mark, the newest member of our team.  Mark is currently studying for a
                        degree in environmental science.  When he isn't studying or guiding our rafts through the 
                        drops and stretches, he is busy making the world a better place.  He enjoys volunteering, recycling,
                        tutoring, and fly fishing.

                        From answering phones, keeping the calendar, paying the bills, and updating the website, Angie has
                        it covered.  Angie is an animal lover and owns three dogs, five cats, two goats, a turtle, and 
                        a salt water tank full of beautiful fish.
