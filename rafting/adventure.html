                    <p class="trip-info">
                        A scenic day trip is the perfect adventure for anyone who is new to rafting, looking 
                        for some beautiful nature photos, or a fun day activity for the family.  Departing from 
                        our very own dock on the Snake River, you'll enjoy a calm, trip down the river.  Some of 
                        the highlights include the Whisper Falls, Layered Cake Wall, and Blue Lagoon.  Ending at
                        McCurdie Wash where a bus will be waiting to take you back to base.  With plenty 
                        of time for photos, and lots of local info from our guides, this trip is a crowd pleaser.

                        Our scenic overnight trips are the perfect union of a scenic river experience and a 
                        good old family camping trip.  Enjoy the day on the river and catch all the highlights
                        of our regular scenic day trip.  Then we pull into Hardy's Bend to camp overnight.
                        Wake up to fresh mountain air and enjoy a warm breakfast 
                        before we hop in the rafts for a quick float to see the Ribbon Winder and The View.  
                        We land at Johnson Stretch where buses will take you back to base.

                    <p class="trip-info">
                        A day trip is perfect for whitewater beginners.  Prepare to move fast and get wet.
                        This day trip is nicely spaced with calms between the rapids for adjustments and 
                        instructions from the guide.  We start at McCurdie Wash and end at Old Mill.
                        Highlights of this trip include the Ribbon Winder, 
                        Lucky Duck, and Widow Maker.  It's equal parts fun, excitement, and splashes! A short 
                        bus trip to the take off point and a bus trip back to base are part of the trip.
