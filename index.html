        <h1>Brianna Chandler's Tidbits on Stargazing</h1>
        <p>"We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance,
            that the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of 
            earths like ours.  If I had remembered this it would have prevented 
            some mistakes.  <strong>This</strong> was not the light in which I hoed them.  
            The stars are the apexes of what wonderful triangles!  What distant and different
            beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the
            same one at the same moment!  Nature and human life are as various as
            our several constitutions.  Who shall say what prospect life offers to
            another?  Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through
            each other's eyes for an instant?  We should live in all the ages of the
            world in an hour; ay, in all the worlds of the ages.  History, Poetry,
            Mythology! - I know of no reading of another's experience so startling 
            and informing as this would be." - Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em>.
