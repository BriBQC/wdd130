                            <h3>What are Asanas?</h3>
                            <p>Asana is sanskrit for "posture".  Yoga poses are asanas.  These are poses
                                that make up the flows we practice in class.  Asanas are the third limb of 
                                ashtanga yoga and the what most people associate yoga with.  Our classes offer
                                a variety of asanas from beginner to advanced levels.  Instructors in our
                                classes will demonstrate the basic pose and offer variations based off the
                                needs of the students.  Every pose has a variation for every body type and
                                learning level.

                            <h2>Chakras</h2>
                            <h3>What are Chakras?</h3>
                            <p>The sanskrit word chakra means "wheel".  Chakras are wheels of energy located along 
                                the central spine.  These wheels manage energy for areas of the body and connect
                                with each other.  These wheels receive energy, turn it into the form you need, then
                                transmit it along the energy lines of your body.  The also do this when it comes to 
                                energy that needs to leave the body.  There are seven chakras as shown in the image
                                below.  1. Sahsrara or crown chakra.  2. Ajna or third-eye chakra.  3. Vissudha or
                                throat chakra.  4. Anahata or heart chakra.  5. Manipura or solar plexus chakra.  
                                6. Svadhisthana or sacral chakra. And 7. Muladhara or root chakra.  Each one is 
                                unique in its location, element, goals, and connection.  Chakra
                                study can become very involved and we have some wondeful books on the topic in our
                                shop for those interested in deepening their understanding of this system.

                            <h3>What are Intentions?</h3>
                            <p>We set intentions at the beginning of every class.  Intentions set the mood for
                                your practice and help us bring what we gain during that pracitice along with us 
                                as we re-enter our regular day.  Intentions can be anything you want them to be.
                                Our instructors will encourage you to set your intentions to something you feel
                                you need to work or focus on in your life, or something that you need to see or
                                feel more at this time, or even to something that you want to invite into your 
                                life at this time.  Intentions can be difficult for some because they
                                are so broad in scope.  Check out the examples below to get you started.

                            <h3>What are Mantras?</h3>
                            <p>A mantra is a "tool for the mind" and a mantra practice is also called
                                the yoga of sound.  Most often used to awaken the chakras and help
                                energy to flow.  Mantras are sounds, vibrations that awaken our
                                consciousness.  Mantras can be audible or inward, spoken in our minds.
                                Audible mantras are good for connecting within a group and inward mantras
                                are good for personal connection deep within.  Mantras can be traditional
                                like the following examples or they can be words that have speical 
                                meaning to us.
                            </p>

                                <h3>Om:</h3>
                                <p>This is the base sound that carries all other sounds with it through
                                    the universe.  This mantra will bring you into balance with the world
                                    around you which in turn brings insights, connections, and renewed 
                                    energy.
                                </p>
                                <h3>So Hum:</h3>
                                <p>This mantra means "I Am".  Heard in most yoga classes, it is a wonderful
                                    mantra to use as you breathe to remind you of your self and how you 
                                    are connected to this moment, this world, this universe.  A centering
                                    and calmind mantra to focus on breath and life.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Sham:</h3>
                                <p>This mantra is perfect to use if you need to let go of anything that
                                    no longer serves you.  Great for addictions, stress, anxiety, hoarding,
                                    or any other type of excessiveness that you need to practice letting go.
                                    Sham will focus your mind and help you find a new source of power within.
                                </p>

                            <h2>Mudras</h2>
                            <h3>What are Mudras?</h3>
                            <p>Mudra in sanskrit means "seal".  Most are used to "seal" and direct the flow of energy
                                through the body.  Hand or "hasta" mudras are the most common and are helpful to 
                                create balance, cleanse, and heal the body.  Based upon placement of the fingers and 
                                hands different types of energy can be directed to specific parts of the body.
                                Here at Breathe we use hasta mudras in all our classes.  here are the main ones
                                you will see being used at our studio:

                                <h3>Anjali</h3>
                                <p>Or prayer position as you'll hear it most often referred, Anjali has multiple 
                                    uses around the world including: pranayama, meditation, greeting, and reverence.
                                    Anjali mudra is used to connect mind, body, and heart. The hands coming together
                                    represent mind connecting with body and the two hands touching the heart brings
                                    all three into balance.

                                <p>Best used during meditation practice, Dhyana mudra is about balance, calmness,
                                    concentration, and healing.  The left palm, representing illusion, supports
                                    the right palm, representing awareness, with the thumbs resting gently together.
                                    This pose is easier to hold for longer periods of time in meditation or sitting
                                    pranayama practices than some other mudras.

                            <h3>What is Sanskrit?</h3>
                            <p>Sanskrit is an ancient Indian language.  Sanskrit words are deep in meaning - Sanskrit itself means
                                language of the gods.  This language is used most yoga often in yoga classes when teachers
                                are referring to poses as all yoga poses have a sanskrit version of their name.  Our classes also
                                incorporate several other sanskrit words.  You'll hear our teachers always offering the english 
                                translation of any sanskrit used in class.  Learning a little sanskrit can be helpful to get started
                                with any yoga class or broaden your experience further if you practice regularly.  Here are a few
                                words you will hear often in our classes:
