                    <p>Slow pacing, careful breakdowns of poses and variations, breathwork, and a good
                        full body stretch make this the perfect class for beginners.  Newcomers to
                        yoga will love the slower pace and detailed instructions as well as learning
                        the basic flow of a class from intentions to shavasana.  This class is great if 
                        you need to focus your mind, get deeper understanding of the poses, or just need
                        a good stretch without a cardio workout, this is the class for you.  Benefits 
                        include full body stretch, deeper pose breakdowns, breathwork, clarity of mind,
                        and refreshed muscles.

                    <h3>Beginner to Advanced | 20 minutes | Free Online Sessions</h3>
                    <p>Our pranayama classes are all about breathwork.  We only assume a small handful
                        of postures in these classes.  If you are new to pranayama we recommend staring
                        with our pranayama basics video which will go over the postures, mudras, and 
                        expectations of the classes.  We have beginner, intermediate, and advanced 
                        versions of each pranayama class.  Each excercise will guide you through a 
                        pranayama technique step by step, then an actual practice with the instructor,
                        and finally a reflection moment where we encourage you to ponder the sensations
                        and thoughts the practice brought to you.  Each practice lists the benefits ranging
                        from calming to energizing, mental clarity to improved circulation.  Free to all
                        members, we encourage working through these videos until you are comfortable with
                        the techniques taught.  In our advanced classes we use pranayama flows to warm up
                        and help cool down.

                    <h3>Beginner to Advanced | 60 minutes | Tuesday & Thursday 6am</h3>
                    <p>Vinyasa is the next level from our Hatha yoga classes.  You'll find the same poses and
                        breathwork as introduced in hatha, but at a faster pace.  Here you will practice 
                        connecting the breath to movement.  As you breathe in you change poses, as you breathe 
                        out you change again, and so on as instructed by the teacher.  In vinyasa you'll build
                        up a comfortable level of heat and might even find yourself sweating!  Perfect for 
                        toning and mild cardio needs as well as mental focus, improved balance, clearer
                        thoughts and deeper connection to breath.

                    <h3>Beginner to Advanced | 60 minutes | Tuesday & Thursday 7pm</h3>
                    <p>This practice is all about the deep muscles and connective tissues and meditation.
                        In yin we have a gentle warm up to get the energy flowing and then we move into the
                        yin postures.  Yin requires us to move into a posture just until we feel the stretch
                        and then we hold the posture, breath full and deep, and feel our body slowly melt 
                        into the stretch.  You'll find in yin that you'll be able to move deeper into a 
                        posture than you can in a regular yoga class.  Yin classes will leave you with a 
                        deep sense of relaxation and peace.  Perfect for those who need to work out deeper
                        tension, improve the stretch of muscles, or need full body relaxation
                        will find it in this class.  Ending with a long shavasana to integrate all the work
                        done in these deepening postures you're sure to leave feeling euphoric.

                    <h3>Beginner to Advanced | 60 minutes | Wednesday 7pm</h3>
                    <p>The practice of yoga nidra is translated as "yogic sleep".  Yes, we are in a laying down
                        posture the entire time, and yes we look like we are sleeping.  However, this class is 
                        anything but sleeping.  Yoga nidra is about attaining that space between wake and sleep
                        where your subconscious reigns supreme.  Our instructors will start by guiding you into the best 
                        nidra position for your body.  Then they will proceed to instruct you on relaxing each and 
                        every individual part of your body, one at a time.  The process is slow precisely so you 
                        can work on any difficult spots and attain as deep a state of subconsciousness as possible. 
                        Soft music, dim lighting, a calm soothing voice walking you through the steps all help to
                        facilitate this yogic sleep.  Benefits include clarity of mind and spirit, connection to
                        our higher selves, deep relaxation for mind and body, and a sense of overall peace.
